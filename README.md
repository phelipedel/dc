## Contributing

If you have a bug report, open an issue. Try to include as much detail as possible. If applicable, include screenshots of the browser console. Please do NOT just say "it doesn't work". 

Put feature suggestions in [this discussion](https://github.com/ItsPi3141/discord-fake-avatar-decorations/discussions/4).

If you want an avatar decoration to be added, make pull request. If you don't know how, then open an issue and attach the asset files. Note that they must be an official avatar decoration made by Discord (e.g. decorations from past years).
